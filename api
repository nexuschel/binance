In order to make addresses trusted using the Binance API, you would need to perform the following steps:

Authenticate with the Binance API using your API key and secret.
Retrieve the address you want to mark as trusted.
Make a request to the Binance API to add the address to the trusted list.
Here's an example of how you can use the Binance API to make an address trusted in Python:

import requests
import json
import hashlib
import hmac
import time

# Set your Binance API key and secret
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
api_secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"

# Set the address you want to mark as trusted
address = "YOUR_ADDRESS"

# Set the Binance API endpoint for adding an address to the trusted list
url = "https://api.binance.com/sapi/v1/capital/config/getall"

# Generate a timestamp for the request
timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)

# Build the request payload
payload = 
Generate the signature using the API secret
params = '&'.join([f"

=

" for k, v in payload.items()]) signature = hmac.new(api_secret.encode('utf-8'), params.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

Add the signature to the payload
payload['signature'] = signature

Add the API key to the request headers
headers =

Make the API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=payload)

Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200: # Parse the response JSON data = response.json()

# Check if the address exists in the response
for config in data:
    if config['address'] == address:
        # Mark the address as trusted
        config['trusted'] = True
        break

# Convert the updated data back to JSON string
updated_data = json.dumps(data)

# Call the Binance API again to update the trusted list
update_url = "https://api.binance.com/sapi/v1/capital/config/update"

# Generate a new timestamp for the update request
update_timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)

# Append the additional parameters for the update request
update_payload = 
=

" for k, v in payload.items()]) signature = hmac.new(api_secret.encode('utf-8'), params.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

Add the signature to the payload
payload['signature'] = signature

Add the API key to the request headers
headers = { 'X-MBX-APIKEY': api_key }

Make the API request
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=payload)

Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200: # Parse the response JSON data = response.json()

# Check if the address exists in the response
for config in data:
    if config['address'] == address:
        # Mark the address as trusted
        config['trusted'] = True
        break

# Convert the updated data back to JSON string
updated_data = json.dumps(data)

# Call the Binance API again to update the trusted list
update_url = "https://api.binance.com/sapi/v1/capital/config/update"

# Generate a new timestamp for the update request
update_timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)

# Append the additional parameters for the update request
update_payload = {
    'timestamp': update_timestamp,
    'data': updated_data,
}

# Generate the signature for the update request
update_params = '&'.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in update_payload.items()])
update_signature = hmac.new(api_secret.encode('utf-8'), update_params.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

# Add the update signature to the update payload
update_payload['signature'] = update_signature

# Make the update request to mark the address as trusted
update_response = requests.post(update_url, headers=headers, params=update_payload)

# Check if the update request was successful
if update_response.status_code == 200:
    print(f"The address 
has been marked as trusted.") else: print("Failed to update the trusted list.") else: print("Failed to retrieve the trusted list.")


Note: This code assumes that you have already generated your API key and secret from the Binance website. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_API_SECRET` with your own credentials, and `YOUR_ADDRESS` with the address you want to mark as trusted.

Please be cautious when making changes to trusted addresses, as it may have implications for your account security. Make sure to thoroughly understand the Binance API documentation and security practices before implementing any changes.
